# Stock-Trend-Prediction

Stock trend prediction is a challenging task that has gained significant attention in the field of finance and machine learning. By leveraging historical stock price data and applying machine learning algorithms, we can develop models that aim to forecast future stock trends. These models can provide valuable insights to investors and traders in making informed decisions.

This repository contains a machine learning model implemented in Python for predicting stock trends. The model utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn to preprocess the data and create an accurate prediction.
